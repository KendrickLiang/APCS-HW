Response to
Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"
@-------------------------------------------------
     It was nice to see the host, Neil deGrasse Tyson, take the time to pay respects to Carl Sagan, who not only hosted the original series of Cosmos, but apparently inspired Tyson too.
The imagery in the first few seconds alone is pretty vivid, and combined with the ambient background music, made watching this episode fairly immersive experience. It did initially 
seem a bit odd when Tyson suddenly introduced the idea of a "spaceship of imagination" to explore the scientific topics that would be discussed, but after a while I just got used to it.
The emphasis of the scientific method (testing ideas through experimentation, building evidence, and questioning preexisting ideas) was also an important addition because of how useful
it is for finding the answers to any question, even in APCS. When Tyson started describing where Earth was in the universe, I was surprised to see just how far and wide "the universe"
actually reached. It was also humbling to know that if the universe's timeline were compared to a calendar, then us humans only started existing in the last hour of the last day of the
universal "year". The fact that in olden times, the church prohibited people from pursuing experiments and expressing opinions contrary to its beliefs really makes me feel lucky that I
live in a country where I have the freedom to say what I want to without fear.

Episode 3 - "When Knowledge Conquered Fear"

     The comparison of humankind to a baby is appropriate, as it refers back to the first episode, which describes just how young and clueless humans are compared to the rest of the 
universe. It was also interesting to see that people back then had to rely on the sky to make decisions about where to go and how to handle upcoming, natural events. Tyson details how
different people can derive different meanings from the sky, yet every culture seemed to think that a comet was a bad omen in some way, shape, or form. If there was no way to 
scientifically discern the cause of an event such as that, there would a surprisingly wide and possibly ludicrous range of explanations made by people who wouldn't know what they were 
talking about. When Newton's life was being explained, the fact that he was a shut-in in his university years made quite a contrast with the dignified scholar that most sources portray 
him as. Yet even with such a quirk, he still was enough of a genius to somehow figure out the relationship between gravitational pull and distance between two objects before renowned
scientists of his time could. This is further evidenced by the fact that Halley was so convinved of Newton's genius that he was willing to bolster the Royal Society's funds by buying
its previous texts about fish and tell Hooke off when Hooke accused Newton of stealing his ideas about gravity and confronted him.
